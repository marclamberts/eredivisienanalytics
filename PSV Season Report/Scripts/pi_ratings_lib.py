"""
Shared Pi-rating engine (Constantinou & Fenton, 2013) for Eredivisie 2025/26.

Each team carries two ratings -- a home rating and an away rating. After
every match, both are updated based on how much the actual goal
difference surprised the model (scaled by lambda), and each team's
*other* rating is partially nudged toward that same movement (scaled by
gamma), since home form carries some information about away form and
vice versa.

    g(x)      = C * log10(1 + |x|) * sign(x)      -- compresses goal
                differences/rating gaps so a 4-goal win doesn't move
                the rating 4x as much as a 1-goal win
    expected  = g(home_rating[H] - away_rating[A])
    error     = (home_goals - away_goals) - expected
    home_rating[H] += lambda * error
    away_rating[A] -= lambda * error
    away_rating[H] += gamma * (new_home_rating[H] - old_home_rating[H])
    home_rating[A] += gamma * (new_away_rating[A] - old_away_rating[A])

This is a from-scratch reimplementation matched to the published
structure (not a reproduction of any specific prior codebase), tuned
with the same lambda/gamma the reference charts used.
